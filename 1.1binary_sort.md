# Question:

Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you're searching 
through it using binary search. What's the maximum number of 
steps it would take?

# Answer:

Maximum number of tries = Worst case scenario

In Binary Search, Worst case scenario means O(log n)

Hence, it would take log 128 = 7
