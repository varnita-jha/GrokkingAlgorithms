# Give the run time for each of these scenarios in terms of big O.

You want to read the numbers of just the As.

# Answer

In the best case scenario, there are only 1 A's. Which means complexity = O(1)

But, in the worst case, all the entries start from A. 

Which means it might take n turns to reach each entry of just the A's

Hence, the run time here also would be O(n)
